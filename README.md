    ## Color Scheme
    The color scheme I have choosen for the site is based on the main background image for the site. the dominant color of the image is brown and Upon furthe research into color schemes I found this particular color scheme from [schemecolor.com](https://www.schemecolor.com/tan-brown-white-black.php#:~:text=Tan%20Brown%2C%20White%20%26%20Black%20Color%20Scheme%20The,This%20color%20combination%20was%20created%20by%20user%20Manish.).

    deciding to keep the site as simple as posiible asthetically along with the brown I have decided upon the two additional colors of white (#fff) and black (#000)

    ## Typeography

    The fonts used within this project are pacifico and Areial, the decision behind this is that they are both commonly used wityhin website design and appear to compliment each other well. The pacifico font is primarily used for headings to help them stand out and the arial font for the main content to ensure the text is easy to read on any device size.

    ## Structure

    The structure of the website is designed to be common place in regards to what a user would expect. The navigation menu is at the top of the page whilst the footer with social links is at the bottom of the page with the content in the middle.

    TAhe navigation bar sat the top had an active class on each page so that the user knows exactly where they are within the website.

    Each section of content is clearly defined with a header so the user knows exactly what to expect from each section of content.

    The pages follow a clear order in regards to the way the content is layed out. So the user can go from the home page to the About me page, to the Projects page and finally the contact page, however the navigation bar fixed at the top of each page gives the user a choice of which pages they would like to view and in what order.

    ## Features

    ### Active Navigation Bar and Logo
    
     The Navigation bar is situated at the top of each page on the website. It follows standard conventions within Web development and Web design. This ensures that users know what to expect when immediatley entering the website.

     The Navigation Bar has 4 links including "Home" "About" "Projects" and "Xontact". When the users hovers over each navigation link it will appear underlined and when the user navigates to a particular page that page the title of that page will be underlined within the navigationbar so that the user knows exactly where they are within the structure of the website.

     The Logo is also a link that when clicked will take the user to the home page. The Logo itself appears above the navigation links on all screen sizes.


     ### Introduction and Profile Image

     Underneath the navigation bar on the Home Page will appear a written introduction so that the user will instantly know what the website is about. The written introduction is also accompanied by a profile image so that the user has more of a connection with the portfolio website and actually get to see what the developer of the website looks like.


     ### About Me Section

     The About Me section gives the user an understanding of what I am currently doing in regards to software development as well as any education or work experience that has been undertaken in the past.


     ### Languages I am Learning Section

     This section gives the user an overview of the languages I am currently learning throughout my studies. FontAwesome has been used by placing a logo of each coding language to make the section more accessible.


     ### Get In Touch Section

     This section gives the user a call to action. It is placed underneath the About Me section and Languages I am Learning Section, to give the user change to learn a bit more about the developer before in viting them to "Get In Touch" via a button that is a link to the Contact Page.

     
     ### Projects Section

     The Projects Section consists of 3 subsections. Each section  consists of the title of the project and image of the final project, a written description of the project and a button which is a link to each projects GitHub repository.
      The images are placed below the title and above the written description when the site is viewed on mobile and tablet devices however this changes when the site is viewed on larger screens as the images appear next to the descriptions ( See image below).


    ### Contact Page

    This gives both new and returning users the opportunity to contact the developer in regards to 
    questions they may have in regards to the website, User Experience or the work that the developer has undertaken.

    The fields requested are 
    First Name
    Last Name
    Email
    Message
     The first 3 fields are required information and if one of the fields is incomplete there will be a prompt to remind the user to complete the missing information.


     ### footer

     The footer follows a similar format to the Logo and navigation bar, the footer contains 4 links using images aquired from FontAwesome. These links are designed to invite the user to visit the developers social media channels. The channelks being used are Faceboot, Instagram, Linkedin and Twitter.
